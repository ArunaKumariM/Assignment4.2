#Assignment 4.2

# 1. Perform a string operation 
#  Replace the period character "." within each string with another character
# i.e "-" minus sign

X <- c('data.science.in.R','machine.learning.in.R')
gsub("[.]","-",X)

#2. Perform a string operation 
#   Append again with "-" minus sign character at the start of each string and 
#   finally concatenate all the string within the vector to form a final single
#   string and assigning it to some object

X <- c('data.science.in.R','machine.learning.in.R')

Y = paste(paste0("-", gsub("[.]", "-", X)), collapse=" ")
print(Y)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
